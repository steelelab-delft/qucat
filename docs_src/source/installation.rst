Requirements
============

Qucat depends on several open-source libraries. 
The following packages are currently required:

* Python 3, tested on version 3.7
* Numpy, tested on version 1.16.2
* Matplotlib, tested on version 3.0.3
* Sympy, tested on version 1.3

Generating a Hamiltonian requires

* `QuTiP <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html>`_, tested on version 4.3

Performance of Sympy and thus QuCAT is enhanced by using

* `gmpy2 <https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

We recommend installing python and these packages by 
downloading and installing 
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_.

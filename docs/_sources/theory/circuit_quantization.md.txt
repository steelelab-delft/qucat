Circuit quantization overview {#sec:circuit_quantization_overview}
=============================

![ **Example of equivalent circuit construction to prepare for
quantization.** We use the same example as used in
Fig [\[fig:1\]](#fig:1){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:1"}-[\[fig:3\]](#fig:3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:3"}. **(a)** The circuit is linearized by replacing the
junction with an inductance $L_j$. The circuit is characterized at the
nodes of the junction by its admittance $Y_j$. **(b)** In the limit of
small dissipation, this circuit is equivalent to a series combination of
RLC resonators. ](figures/fig_circuit_quantization.pdf)

In this section we summarize the quantization method used in QuCAT,
which is an expansion on the work of Ref. [@nigg_black-box_2012]. This
approach is only valid in the weak anharmonic limit, where charge
dispersion is negligible. See [@nigg_black-box_2012] or
Sec. [9.2](#sec:high_anharmonicity){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:high_anharmonicity"} for a detailed discussion of this
condition.

The idea behind the quantization method is as follows. We first consider
the "linearized\" circuit. This is a circuit where the junctions are
replaced by their Josephson inductances $L_j = \phi_0^2/E_j$. where
$E_j$ is the Josephson energy and the reduced flux quantum is given by
$\phi_0 = \hbar/2e$. We determine the oscillation frequencies and
dissipation rates of the different normal modes of this linearized
circuit. Then, we calculate the amplitude of phase oscillations across
each junction when a given mode is excited. This will determine how
non-linear each mode is. All this information will finally allow us to
build a Hamiltonian for the circuit.

Circuit simplification to series of RLC resonators (Foster circuit)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The eigenfrequencies and non-linearity of each mode is obtained by
transforming the linearized circuit to a geometry we can easily analyze.
We will first describe this process assuming there is only a single
junction in the circuit, the case of multiple junctions will follow. We
consider the example circuit of
Fig. [\[fig:1\]](#fig:1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:1"}. After
replacing the junction with its Josephson inductance, we determine the
admittance $Y_j(\omega) = I_j(\omega)/V_j(\omega)$ evaluated at the
nodes of the junction. This admittance is the inverse of the impedance
measured at the nodes of the junction. It relates the amplitude $|V_j|$
and phase $\theta(V_j)$ of the voltage oscillating at frequency $\omega$
that would build up across the junction if one would feed a current
oscillating at $\omega$ with amplitude $|I_j|$ and phase $\theta(I_j)$
to one of its nodes through a infinite impedance current source. In
Fig. [\[fig:circuit\_quantization\]](#fig:circuit_quantization){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:circuit_quantization"}(a) we show a schematic describing
this quantity. In the case where all normal modes of the circuit have
small dissipation rates, this circuit has an approximate equivalent
shown in
Fig. [\[fig:circuit\_quantization\]](#fig:circuit_quantization){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:circuit_quantization"}(b), consisting of a series of RLC
resonators [@solgun2014blackbox]. By equivalent, we mean that the
admittance $Y_j$ of the circuit is approximatively equal to that of a
series combination of RLC resonators
$$Y_j(\omega) \simeq  \frac{1}{\sum_m1/Y_m(\omega)}\
  \label{eq:Y_as_sum}$$ which each have an admittance
$$Y_m(\omega) = \frac{1}{iL_m\omega}+iC_m\omega+\frac{1}{R_m}$$ Each RLC
resonator represents a normal mode of the circuit, with resonance
frequency $\omega_m = 1/\sqrt{L_mC_m}$, and dissipation rate
$\kappa_m = 1/R_mC_m$. Since this equivalent circuit comes from an
extension of Foster's reactance theorem [@foster1924reactance] to lossy
circuits, we call this the Foster circuit.

Hamiltonian of the Foster circuit
---------------------------------

The advantage of this circuit form, is that it is easy to write its
corresponding Hamiltonian following standard quantization methods (see
Ref. [@vool2017introduction]). In the absence of junction non-linearity,
it is given by the sum of the the Hamiltonians of the independent
harmonic RLC oscillators:
$$\sum_m \hbar \omega_m\hat a_m^\dagger \hat a_m\ .$$ The annihilation
operator $\hat a_m$ for photons in mode $m$ is related to the expression
of the phase difference between the two nodes of the oscillator
$$\begin{split}
  \hat\varphi_{m,j} &= \varphi_{\text{zpf},m,j}(\hat a_m + \hat a^\dagger_m)\ ,\\
  \varphi_{\text{zpf},m,j} &= \frac{1}{\phi_0}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2\omega_m C_m}}\ .
\label{eq:zpf}
\end{split}$$ where $\varphi_{\text{zpf},m}$ are the zero-point
fluctuations in phase of mode $m$. The total phase difference across the
Josephson junction $\hat\varphi_j$ is then the sum of these phase
differences $\hat\varphi_j = \sum_m\hat\varphi_{m,j}$, and we can add
the Junction non-linearity to the Hamiltonian
$$\hat{H} = \sum_m \hbar\omega_m\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m + E_j[1-\cos{\hat\varphi_j}-\frac{\hat\varphi_j^2}{2}]\ ,$$
Since the linear part of the Hamiltonian corresponds to the circuit with
junctions replaced by inductors, the linear part already contains the
quadratic contribution of the junction potential
$\propto\hat\varphi_j^2$, and it is subtracted from the cosine junction
potential.

Calculating Foster circuit parameters
-------------------------------------

Both $\omega_m$ and $\kappa_m$ can be determined from $Y(\omega)$ since
we have $Y(\omega_m+i\kappa_m/2)=0$ for low loss circuits. This can be
proven by noticing that the admittance $Y_m$ of mode $m$ has two zeros
at $$\begin{split}
  \zeta_m &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{L_mC_m}}\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{4Q^2}}+ i\frac{1}{2R_mC_m}\\
  &\simeq \omega_m + i\kappa_m/2\ .
\end{split}$$ and $\zeta_m^*$. The approximate equality holds in the
limit of large quality factor $Q_m = R_m/\sqrt{L_m/C_m}\gg 1$. From
Eq. ([\[eq:Y\_as\_sum\]](#eq:Y_as_sum){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Y_as_sum"}) we see that the zeros of $Y$ are exactly the
zeros of the admittances $Y_k$. The solutions of $Y(\omega)=0$, which
come in conjugate pairs $\zeta_m$ and $\zeta_m^*$, thus provide us with
both resonance frequencies $\omega_m = \text{Re}[\zeta_m]$ and
dissipation rates $\kappa_m = 2\text{Im}[\zeta_m]$.

Additionally, we need to determine the effective capacitances $C_m$ in
order to obtain the zero-point fluctuations in phase of each mode. We
focus on one mode $k$, and start by rewriting the admittance in
Eq. ([\[eq:Y\_as\_sum\]](#eq:Y_as_sum){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:Y_as_sum"}) as
$$Y_j(\omega) =  Y_k(\omega)\frac{1}{1+\sum_{m\ne k}Y_k(\omega)/Y_m(\omega)}\ .$$
Its derivative with respect to $\omega$ is $$\begin{split}
  Y'_j(\omega) &=  Y'_k(\omega)\frac{1}{1+\sum_{m\ne k}Y_k(\omega)/Y_m(\omega)}\\
  &+Y_k(\omega)\frac{\partial}{\partial \omega}\left [\frac{1}{1+\sum_{m\ne k}Y_k(\omega)/Y_m(\omega)}\right ]\ .
\end{split}$$ Evaluating the derivative at $\omega = \zeta_k$, where
$Y_k(\zeta_k)=0$ yields $$\begin{split}
  Y'_j(\zeta_k) &= Y'_k(\zeta_k) = iC_m\left(1+\frac{4Q^2}{\left(i+\sqrt{4Q^2-1}\right)^2} \right)\\
  &\simeq i2C_m\text{ for }Q_m\gg 1
\end{split}$$ The capacitance is thus approximatively given by
$$C_m = \text{Im}\left[Y'_j(\zeta_k)\right]/2$$

Multiple junctions
------------------

When more than a single junction is present, we start by choosing a
single reference junction, labeled $r$. All junctions will be again
replaced by their inductances, and by using the admittance $Y_r$ across
the reference junction, we can determine the Hamiltonian including the
non-linearity of the reference junction through the procedure described
above.

In this section, we will describe how to obtain the Hamiltonian
including the non-linearity of all other junctions too
$$\hat H = \sum_m \hbar\omega_m\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m + \sum_j E_j[1-\cos{\hat\varphi_j}-\frac{\hat\varphi_j^2}{2}]\ ,
\label{eq:hamiltonian_no_taylor}$$ where $\hat\varphi_j$ is the phase
across the j-th junction. This phase is determined by first calculating
the zero-point fluctuations in phase $\varphi_{\text{zpf},m,r}$ through
the reference junction $r$ for each mode $m$ given by
Eq. ([\[eq:zpf\]](#eq:zpf){reference-type="ref" reference="eq:zpf"}).
For each junction $j$, we then calculate the (complex) transfer function
$T_{jr}(\omega)$ which converts phase in the reference junction to phase
in junction $j$. We can then calculate the total phase across a junction
$j$ with respect to the reference phase of junction $r$, summing the
contributions of all modes and both quadratures of the phase
$$\begin{split}
\hat\varphi_j = \sum_m\varphi_{\text{zpf},m,r}[\text{Re}\left (T_{jr}(\omega_m)\right )(\hat{a}_m+\hat{a}_m^\dagger)\\
-i\ \text{Im}\left (T_{jr}(\omega_m)\right )(\hat{a}_m-\hat{a}_m^\dagger)]
\end{split}
\label{eq:phi_j_from_phi_r}$$

The definition of phase [@vool2017introduction]
$\varphi_j(t) = \phi_0^{-1}\int_{-\infty}^tv_j(\tau)d\tau$ where $v_j$
is the voltage across junction $j$ translates in the frequency domain to
$\varphi_j(\omega) = i\omega\phi_0^{-1}V_j(\omega)$. Finding the
transfer function $T_{jr}$ for phase is thus equivalent to finding a
transfer function for voltage
$T_{jr}(\omega) = V_j(\omega)/V_r(\omega)$. This is a standard task in
microwave network analysis (see
Sec. [8.3](#sec:methods_network_transfer){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec:methods_network_transfer"} for more details).

Further treatment of the Hamiltonian
------------------------------------

The cosine potential in
Eq. ([\[eq:hamiltonian\_no\_taylor\]](#eq:hamiltonian_no_taylor){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:hamiltonian_no_taylor"}) can be expressed in the Fock
basis by Taylor expanding it around small values of the phase. This
yields $$\begin{split}
\hat{H} &= \sum_{m} \hbar\omega_m\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m\\
&+ \sum_j\sum_{n\ge 2}E_j\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(2n)!}\left[\sum_{m}\varphi_{\text{zpf},m,j}(\hat{a}_m^\dagger+\hat{a}_m)\right]^{2n}
\end{split}
\label{eq:hamiltonian_taylor}$$ which is the form returned by the QuCAT
`hamiltonian` method. By keeping only the fourth power in the Taylor
expansion and performing first order perturbation theory, we obtain
$$\begin{split}
\hat{H} = \sum_m\sum_{n\ne m} (\hbar\omega_m-A_m-\frac{\chi_{mn}}{2})\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m \\
-\frac{A_m}{2}\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m\hat{a}_m -\chi_{mn}\hat{a}_m^\dagger\hat{a}_m\hat{a}_n^\dagger\hat{a}_n
\label{eq:hamiltonian_first_order}
\end{split}$$ Where the anharmonicity or self-Kerr of mode m is
$$A_m = \sum_j A_{m,j}$$ as returned by the `anharmonicites` method,
where $$A_{m,j} = \frac{E_j}{2}\varphi_{\text{zpf},m,j}^4
\label{eq:Amj}$$ is the contribution of junction j to the total
anharmonicity of a mode m. The cross-Kerr coupling between mode m and n
is $$\chi_m = 2\sqrt{A_mA_n}\ .$$ Both self and cross-Kerr parameters
are computed by the `kerr` method. Note in
Eq. [\[eq:hamiltonian\_first\_order\]](#eq:hamiltonian_first_order){reference-type="ref"
reference="eq:hamiltonian_first_order"} that the harmonic frequency of
the Hamiltonian is shifted by $A_m$ and $\sum_{n\ne m}\chi_{nm}/2$. The
former comes from the change in Josephson inductance induced by phase
fluctuations of mode $m$. The latter is called the Lamb
shift [@gely2017nature] and is induced by phase fluctuations of the
other modes of the circuit.
